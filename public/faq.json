        "question": "What is the difference between SEO and PPC?",
        "answer": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) involves optimizing your website and content to rank higher in organic search engine results, without paying for placement. PPC (Pay-Per-Click) advertising, on the other hand, allows advertisers to bid for ad placement in search engine results or on websites and pay only when users click on their ads. While SEO focuses on organic traffic, PPC provides immediate visibility through paid ads."
